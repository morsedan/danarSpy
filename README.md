This app was built in 3.5 days by a two person team with no previous exposure to Apple's MultipeerNetworking framework, the backbone of the wireless networking within the app. The purpose of the app is to demo possibilities available using multipeer networking. Currently, the wireless networking works on simulators running on the same machine.
