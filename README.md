## A machine moderated group game

This app was built in 3.5 days by a two person team with no previous exposure to Apple's MultipeerNetworking framework. This framework is the backbone of the wireless networking within the app. 

The purpose of the app is to demo possibilities available using multipeer networking and to make a group game more fun by eliminating the need for a human moderator. This allows all the players to play. Currently, the wireless networking works on simulators running on the same machine.

I was the primary developer on the wireless networking and the game logic. I also pitched in with the custom button and some input for the UX.
