A machine moderated group game

This app was built in 3.5 days by a two person team with no previous exposure to Apple's MultipeerNetworking framework, the backbone of the wireless networking within the app.

Currently, the wireless networking works on simulators running on the same machine, but when we added custom UI at the end of the fourth day, the wireless networking between actual devices broke. I haven't had time to figure out what broke. There are also edge cases (and some use cases) that are not covered by the current state of the app.
